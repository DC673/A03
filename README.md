+ **Branch** - is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. By using branches, developers can make changes safely. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch - where all changes get merged back into, is called master.

+ **Cloning** - Cloning is used to create a copy of a specific repository or branch onto the local machine. The ability to work with the entire repository locally means all developers can work more freely.
+ **Commit** - A commit is like a snapshot of your repository. They work like save points within Git. Commits can be made to different branches and users can specify exactly what changes to include. 
+ **Fetch** - Downloads branches and tags from other repositories and the objects that complete their histories.
+ **Pull** - updates your current local branch and all remote tracking branches. Without using pull, your local branch won't have any updates present on the remote branch. It is the most common way to update your repository.
+ **Push** - Updates the remote branch with local commits. It can be thought of as update or publish. A push can be made after making a commit locally. This makes your commits accessible to others who you may be collaboraing with. Any open pull requests will be updated with the branch being worked on.
